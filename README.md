Hi there!

I'm Noah ([@noahnu](https://noahnu.com)), a software developer in Toronto ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ focused on building scalable web applications in TypeScript and Python. Lately I've been focused on frontend infrastructure & tooling.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/noahnu), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1336653/noahnu), and [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/noahnu). If I'm not writing software, I'm cooking, baking, or reading a fantasy novel.

I'm not a big social media user, so if you need to get in touch, a message over LinkedIn is your best bet.

## Project Spotlight

I maintain a few open source projects, however my main focus is on [Monodeploy](https://tophat.github.io/monodeploy/) and [Syrupy](https://github.com/tophat/syrupy).

### What is [Monodeploy](https://tophat.github.io/monodeploy/)?

Monodeploy is a powerful tool which aims to simplify the package publishing process for monorepos. It leverages Yarn Berry workspaces to do the heavy lifting, and is a direct replacement for tools such as Lerna and Semantic Release.

### What is [Syrupy](https://github.com/tophat/syrupy)?

Syrupy is a pytest snapshot plugin. It enables developers to write tests which assert immutability of computed results.
