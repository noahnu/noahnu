Hi there!

I'm Noah ([@noahnu](https://noahnu.com)), a software developer in Toronto ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ focused on building scalable web applications in TypeScript. Lately I've been focused on frontend infrastructure & tooling.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/noahnu), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1336653/noahnu), and [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/noahnu). If I'm not writing software, I'm cooking, baking, or reading a fantasy novel.

I'm not a big social media user, so if you need to get in touch, a message over LinkedIn is your best bet.

## Project Spotlight

I maintain a few open source projects, however my main focus is on [Monoweave](https://monoweave.github.io/monoweave/) and [Syrupy](https://github.com/syrupy-project/syrupy).

### What is [Monoweave](https://monoweave.github.io/monoweave/)?

Monoweave is a powerful tool which aims to simplify the package publishing process for monorepos. It leverages Yarn Modern workspaces to do the heavy lifting, and is a direct replacement for tools such as Lerna and Semantic Release.

### What is [Syrupy](https://github.com/syrupy-project/syrupy)?

Syrupy is a pytest snapshot plugin, bringing Jest-like snapshots to the python ecosystem.
